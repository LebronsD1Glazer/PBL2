                <h1> Why Health Care is Important</h1>
                <p> Health care is important because it helps people stay healthy, catch problems early, and get treatment when they’re sick or injured. 
                    With good health care, people can live longer, feel better, and avoid serious diseases. It also helps communities because healthy 
                    people can work, go to school, and take care of their families. Health care also teaches people how to prevent illness by making good 
                    choices, like eating healthy, exercising, and getting check-ups. Overall, health care keeps individuals and society strong, safe, and
                     able to live a good quality of life.</p>

                <h1> Why we neeed Health Care </h1>
            <p> We need health care because it keeps people healthy and helps them get treatment when something goes wrong. Health care allows 
                doctors tofind problems early before they become dangerous, and it provides medicine, vaccines, and check-ups that prevent sickness. 
                When people get hurt or sick, health care helps them recover and return to their normal lives. It also protects communities by stopping
                 the spread of diseases. Overall, health care is necessary so people can live longer, safer, and healthier lives.</p>

                        Health care is important because it protects our overall well-being and gives people the tools they need to live long, 
                        healthy, productive lives.  We need health care to prevent diseases through vaccines, regular check-ups, screening tests, 
                        and health education, which help doctors catch problems early before they become serious or life-threatening. Health care is also 
                        necessary when people get sick or injured, because hospitals and clinics provide treatments, surgeries, medicine, and emergency 
                        care that can save lives. Without health care, small health problems—like infections—could become major dangers. People use 
                        health care throughout their entire lives: children get checkups and vaccines, adults get screenings for conditions like diabetes or high
                        blood pressure, and older adults receive care that helps them maintain independence. We also use health care to manage long-term conditions 
                        such as asthma, allergies, mental health needs, and more. In everyday life, health care helps us stay informed, teaches us how to prevent illness, 
                        and provides support when our bodies or minds need help. Overall, it is a key part of keeping individuals, families, and communities healthy, safe, 
                        and able to thrive.
