        <h1> Solutions to Reduce Health Care Disparities  </h1>
         <h2> 1. Improve Access to Care </h2>
         <p>To reduce health care disparities, communities need easier access to doctors, clinics, and services. This includes expanding insurance coverage, opening clinics in underserved areas, and offering low-cost or free health programs. Mobile clinics and transportation services also help people who live far from medical facilities get the care they need. </p>

        <section>
       <h2> 2. Increase Health Education</h2>
    <p> Education helps people understand how to stay healthy and where to find care. Providing health workshops, school programs, and information in multiple languages makes it easier for everyone to learn about prevention, healthy habits, and available resources.</p>

        <h2> 3. Address Social Determinants of Health</h2>
    <p>Factors like housing, income, education, food access, and safety all affect health. Supporting programs that improve living conditions, provide healthy food, and offer mental health and community resources can greatly reduce health disparities. </p>

<h2>5.Build Trust in Health Care Systems</h2>
