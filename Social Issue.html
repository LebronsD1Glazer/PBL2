            <h1> Health Care </h1>
             <p> Health care is important because it helps people stay healthy, prevent diseases, and get treatment when they are sick or injured.
                Good health care allows individuals to live longer, safer, and more comfortable lives. It also helps communities stay strong by reducing 
                the spread of illnesses and making sure everyone has access to doctors, medicine, and important information about staying healthy. When people receive proper health care, they can work, learn, and take care of their families better, which makes society as a whole stronger and more successful.</p>

            <h1> Health Care Disparties</h1>
     <p> Health care disparities are differences in the quality, access, or outcomes of health care that certain groups experience compared to others. 
        These differences are not due to personal choices alone— they often come from unfair social, economic, or environmental disadvantages.</p>        </section>

        <h2> A more in depth explaining </h2>
            <p>
                Health care is a system designed to protect our physical and mental well-being, and we use it because it provides the support we need to stay healthy throughout our entire
                 lives. People use health care for many reasons: to prevent illnesses before they happen, to diagnose problems early, and to treat health issues when they occur. 
                 Preventive care—like vaccines, checkups, dental cleanings, and health screenings—helps us avoid serious diseases and catch hidden problems early, when they’re easier
                 and less expensive to treat. We also use health care when we get sick or injured; doctors, nurses, and hospitals provide treatments, medication, and emergency care
                 that help us recover and stay safe. Health care is also used to manage long-term conditions such as asthma, diabetes, allergies, or mental health challenges, allowing
                 people to live normal and productive lives. Beyond treatment, health care teaches us how to live healthier by giving advice about nutrition, exercise, safety, and habits
                 that protect our bodies. Overall, we use health care because it keeps us healthy, helps us heal, and gives us the tools we need to live longer, stronger, and better-quality lives.
